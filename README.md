## Contributing

```
The original Author took the time to comment every single line of code so we could understand what he did better.
As he states in his own repo, Everything in this app can be improved, I 'learned' to use shiny just today and I'm also not very experienced with R as a language.
Feel free to fork this repository, make some changes, add functionality and I'll surely check them out.
Also, take a look to the original project on Jesus Angel's Repo
